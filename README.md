# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether an online shopping session will result in a purchase, using data from 12,330 unique user sessions collected over a one-year period. This prediction is based on various features related to the user's browsing behavior, including the number of pages visited, time spent on different types of pages, bounce rates, exit rates, and more.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 12,330 sessions, with each session corresponding to a different user. The data includes both numerical and categorical features, providing insights into the users' interactions with the website. The features include:

Administrative: The number of administrative pages visited in the session.

Administrative Duration: Total time (in seconds) spent on administrative pages.

Informational: Number of informational pages visited in the session.

Informational Duration: Total time spent on informational pages.

Product Related: Number of product-related pages visited in the session.

Product Related Duration: Total time spent on product-related pages.

Bounce Rates: Average bounce rate of the visited pages.

Exit Rates: Average exit rate of the visited pages.

PageValues: Average value of the pages visited.

SpecialDay: Proximity of the session date to a special day (e.g., Mother's Day, Valentine's Day).

Month: The month in which the session occurred.

OperatingSystems: Operating system used by the user.

Browser: Browser used by the user.

Region: Region from which the user accessed the website.

Traffic Type: Type of traffic (e.g., direct, paid search, organic search).

Visitor Type: Category of the user (Returning Visitor, New Visitor).

Weekend: Indicates if the session occurred on a weekend.

Revenue: Target variable indicating if the session ended in a purchase (1 for yes, 0 for no).

# Project Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of features.
Identify correlations between features.
Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (Revenue).
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.
Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on existing ones.
Transform features to better represent the underlying patterns.
Select the most important features for the model.
4. Model Building
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluate the model using the F1 score due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation
Compare the model's F1 score against the benchmark score of 0.55.
Analyze the precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Make recommendations for improving the model.

# Evaluation Metric
Given the imbalanced nature of the data, the primary evaluation metric for this project is the F1 Score. The benchmark F1 score for this task is 0.55.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Running the Project
Install Dependencies:
Install the required packages using pip:


# Run the Analysis:
Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform EDA, preprocessing, and model building.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model performance against the benchmark F1 score.

# Conclusion
This project aims to accurately predict the purchase intentions of online shoppers using various features derived from their browsing behavior. Through EDA, feature engineering, and SVM modeling, we aim to achieve an F1 score that meets or exceeds the benchmark of 0.55.
